This standalone application makes it possible to create and organize sets of 
flashcards in a way which resembles a filesystem. You can create groupings of
flashcard sets, and nest groupings within one another like folders.

Flashcards engine can be a useful study tool as it provides a great deal of
flexibility in how you organize your flashcards, mirroring exactly the 
structure of your learning plan in order to best design an approach to 
learning new topics.
